# unityFinal

The Floor is Lava was created by Anthony Kakogui, Armando Gonzalez, Minhchau Tran, and Neiel Delgade.
The game is a simple 3-level platform with a goal to reach the end of the game as fast as possible while collecting as many coins as possible.
There is a timer and coin counter that persist through each scene and is displayed at the end.
